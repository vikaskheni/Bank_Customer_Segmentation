# Bank Customer Segmentation Methods

## Description

This project focuses on **Clustering Bank Customers** using various methods available in the **scikit-learn** library. My goal was to gain insights 
into the nature of clustering methods and learn how to use **scikit-learn** to implement these techniques in practical problems. A relevant 
business sector for this application is Finance and Banking, where understanding different customer segments is crucial for the survival 
of any institution providing financial services. This project was also created for a **Kaggle** challenge called **Credit Card Dataset for Clustering**.
The link to this event can be found in the repository description.
